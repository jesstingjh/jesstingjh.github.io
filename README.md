## About Me
I’m a Master’s student in Computational Data Analytics at Georgia Tech, with a strong foundation in economics and statistics from the National University of Singapore. Prior to grad school, I worked as a Senior Economist at Singapore’s Ministry of Trade and Industry, where I applied econometric modeling and data analytics to inform national policy decisions.

I enjoy applying machine learning and statistical techniques to uncover patterns, improve predictions, and generate actionable insights from complex datasets. I'm continually expanding my technical toolkit. Outside of work, I’m into puzzle games, bouldering, weightlifting, and exploring new coffee brews — and recently discovered a love for scuba diving.

## Projects
Below are some of the projects I have worked on as part of my coursework or personal interest. This section will be updated as I complete new projects      

***Context-Aware Sentiment Analysis of Yelp Reviews using Fine-Tuned DistilBERT*** [github](https://github.com/jesstingjh/contextual-sentiment-yelp)
- Fine-tuned an LLM (DistilBERT) to predict positive reviews (4+ stars), incorporating contextual tokens from user and business data. Used stratified sampling, class-weighted loss, and F1-optimized thresholds to handle class imbalance
- Improved accuracy from 71% to 93%, and F1 score from 74% to 95%; used TF-IDF to identify key sentiment drivers across time, location, and business traits

***Outage Detection using Customer Interaction Data (Cox Communications)*** 
- Placed 3rd in cohort-wide competition (MSA Project Week)
- Processed high-volume multichannel customer interaction logs and used anomaly detection models (MSTL, Isolation Forest) to detect latent outages explicitly labeled in the data
- Developed a rolling-window Random Forest model for near real-time outage prediction, enabling faster remediation

***Hierarchical Clustering of Music Tracks for Better Genre Representation***      
(Group project for data and visual analytics class)
- Scraped 220k tracks using Spotify's API and applied stratified sampling and feature engineering (e.g., winsorization, PCA) to improve data quality and ensure balanced genre representation. 
- Implemented HDBSCAN and MBD-BIRCH clustering algorithms on a 128k track sample with parameter tuning, and developed an interactive dashboard to visualize and compare hierarchical clusters and track features

***SNAP US Patent Citation Network Analysis*** [github](https://github.com/jesstingjh/patent-citation-network)
- Analyzed the citation network of US patents (1975-1999) using community detection and influence analysis techniques (Louvain & PageRank algorithms) on a dataset of 3.7 million patent nodes and 16.5 million directed citation edges
- Employed data sampling and preprocessing to handle computational complexity while preserving the network's structural integrity

***Network Monitoring*** [github](https://github.com/jesstingjh/network-monitoring)     
- Optimization project for water distribution network sensor placement using Python, Gurobi Solver and operations research / linear programming techniques 
- Formulated integer programs to place sensors across an 811-sensor, 1123-pipe network, minimizing sensor count while maximizing detection probability and prioritizing critical infrastructure locations
