## About Me
I am a Master's student in Analytics at Georgia Tech, with a strong foundation in economics and statistics from the National University of Singapore. In my previous role as a Senior Economist at Singapore's Ministry of Trade and Industry, I contributed to shaping impactful policy decisions through advanced data analytics, econometric modeling, and statistical techniques. I am deeply passionate about harnessing innovative machine learning and modeling methods to extract actionable insights from complex datasets. Outside of work, I thrive on the challenges of rock climbing and bouldering, push my limits in weightlifting, and am always on the hunt for the perfect cup of coffee.
