## About Me
I am a Master's student in Analytics at Georgia Tech, with a strong foundation in economics and statistics from my undergraduate degree from the National University of Singapore. In my previous role as a Senior Economist at Singapore's Ministry of Trade and Industry, I contributed to shaping impactful policy decisions through advanced data analytics, econometric modeling, and statistical techniques. 

I am deeply passionate about picking up new analytical tools, and harnessing machine learning and modelling methods to extract actionable insights from complex datasets. Outside of work, I enjoy puzzle games, bouldering and weightlifting, being outdoors, and am always on the hunt for interesting coffee beans and brews.


## Technical Skills
**Programming Languages & Software:** Python, SQL, STATA, R, Tableau, Excel; exposure to JavaScript and D3 through coursework   
**Cloud/Big Data**: Exposure to AWS, GCP, PySpark, Databricks, Azure Machine Learning through coursework    
**Statistical/Analytical Skills**:      
- Causal Inference: Survival Analysis, Difference-in-Differences, Matching Methods, Regression Discontinuity Design, Synthetic Controls
- Machine Learning: Regression, Classification, Clustering, Random Forest
- Time Series Analysis: Forecasting, Volatility Modeling
- Others: Data Cleaning & Preprocessing, Optimization & Simulation, Text Analytics


## Projects
Below are some of the projects I have worked on as part of my coursework or personal interest. This section will be updated as I complete new projects      

***Soundscape Cartography: Data-Driven Approach to Music Clustering***      
- Group project for data and visual analytics class
- Collected 220k tracks using the Spotify API, applying stratified sampling and feature engineering (e.g., winsorization, PCA) to improve data quality and ensure balanced genre representation. Implemented HDBSCAN and MBD-BIRCH clustering algorithms on a 128k track sample with parameter tuning, and developed an interactive dashboard to visualize and compare hierarchical clusters and track features

***Patent Citation Network Analysis*** [github](https://github.com/jesstingjh/patent-citation-network)
- Analyzed the citation network of US patents (1975-1999) using community detection and influence analysis techniques (Louvain & PageRank algorithms) on a dataset of 3.7 million patent nodes and 16.5 million directed citation edges
- Employed data sampling and preprocessing to handle computational complexity while preserving the network's structural integrity

***Network Monitoring*** [github](https://github.com/jesstingjh/network-monitoring)     
- Optimization project for water distribution network sensor placement using Python, Gurobi Solver and operations research / linear programming techniques 
- Formulated integer programs to place sensors across an 811-sensor, 1123-pipe network, minimizing sensor count while maximizing detection probability and prioritizing critical infrastructure locations
